                    <b>Polybius</b> was an influential Greek writer of the Hellenistic period primarily known for his histories and political theory writings.
                    One of his most interesting ideas, however, was a framework for an early cryptographic method now known as the <b>Polybius square</b>.
                    It was initially conceived to aid in telegraphy: the transmission of messages over long distances, with Polybius suggesting the codes could
                    be signalled by holding up torches. His ideas of encoding, while primitive, have been used as "knock codes" by Stalinist prisoners attempting
                    to communicate through walls. They've also been suggested as useful in steganography.

                              This algorithm uses a 5x5 square to encode the text. Essentially, the letters are each stored in one cell of the square.
                              The corresponding encoding of a given letter is equal to the row number of the letter concatenated with the column number.
                              For example, e = 15 and v = 51. Because of the size 25 square with a size 26 alphabet, i and j share a cell in their encoding.

                  Although Polybius' idea was certainly interesting, it was likely never used in practice. The first substitution cipher known to be used, meaning
                  a method of encoding where each letter is entirely replaced based on some rule, was the <b>Caesar Cipher</b>. This cipher was employed by the most famous Roman,
                  <b>Julius Caesar</b>, to communicate with his generals during the Gallic Wars. Though the cipher was extremely basic by our standards, in Caesar's time it could
                  have obscured his messages sufficiently to confuse his mostly illiterate adversaries. As of recently, the Caesar Cipher has been used for the ROT13 algorithm,
                  an extremely simple method of encryption meant mostly to encode jokes and non-critical information on the internet. It's also been used unsuccessfully by
                  Mafia members to communicate securely.

                  The encryption algorithms discussed thus far are classified as monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, meaning the technique of replacement
                  remains the same throughout the message. While relatively advanced for their time, these ciphers contained some blatant weaknesses; these weaknesses
                  were exploited by advances during the Islamic Golden Age. <b>Al-Kindi</b>, an Arab polymath during this time period, created an ingenious method analyzing these
                  kinds of ciphers. His technique represented a pivotal moment in the area of cryptanalyis: the field dedicated to analyzing and breaking encrypted messages.
                  His writings on <b>frequency analysis</b> led to the widespread use of these techniques in the Renaissance. Today, computer software is written to carry out this variety
                  of cryptanalysis in seconds, breaking most of the "classical ciphers" quite easily.

                                Monoalphabetic cryptanalysis is based around the idea of frequency calculations. Quite simply, you count up each occurrence
                                of each letter in a phrase. From there, you can compare the relative percentages of each occurrence to each occurrence of a letter
                                within the original langage of the message. For example, if the cipher text contains 22% of the letter 'u' and the English language
                                has a 22% occurrence rate of 'e' in common words, one could reasonably replace the 'u' with the 'e' and see if the decoding matches.

                  The Middle Ages, unfortunately, represented a period of stagnation in cryptography. The Classical and Arabic methods were still known and used,
                  but no significant advances in encoding practices were made for many years. With the aforementioned weaknesses in monoalphabetic ciphers exploited
                  by cryptanalysis, this made the secure transmission of messages problematic. The first major advance since the time of Al-Kindi came with the advent
                  of <b>homophonic ciphers</b>. Homophonic substitution allows for any given character to replaced with any number of alternative characters. The first instance
                  of this encryption technique was seen in a correspondence between the <b>Duke of Mantua</b> with an associate. This method actually took Arabic frequency analysis
                  into account and used it cleverly in the encoding process. The homophonic technique became a standard for government cryptography for most of the Renaissance.

                              This particular homophonic substitution, as mentioned above, accounts for the relative frequency of each letter in the English language.
                              It essentially assumes that vowels will be the most commonly used, and provides multiple replacements for each vowel. In our model, each
                              time a vowel is meant to be encoded, its next possible choice for the cipher is chosen. In the simplest variety, one can just choose the
                              homophonic replacement in order of listing. However, to create even more security for the most frequent letters, you could randomly select an
                              option and use it for encoding. The table used to encode the text in our example is shown above.

                  The <b>Voynich Manuscript</b> is interesting in that we do not know which, if any, cryptographic principle the document follows. Originally discovered in 1912
                  by an antiquarian book dealer, the book is hand-written in a unknown writing system. It was first thought to be written by a 12th century monk, but has now
                  been tracked to within the 15th century by carbon dating. The manuscript is filled with both writing and strange illustrations, and is thought to possibly
                  be an early modern medical text. However, the script is still entirely undeciphered. Some theories propose it to be an esoteric cipher based on letters or even
                  a codebook, some say it might be a completely constructed language, still others state it's a complete hoax. In recent years, AI has been used in an attempt to decode
                  the text with still minimal success. The Voynich Manuscript serves as a fascinating example of a cryptographic anomaly.

                              As I've previously mentioned, no one is sure how it works. One of the recent claims, aided by AI, is that the original language is Hebrew,
                              encoded using alphabetically ordered anagrams. However, this claim has been widely disputed by both Medieval history and Hebrew experts.
                              Maybe one of the most compelling hypotheses is that the book is in fact written in a natural language; that is, some naturally evolved lanugage
                              that just hasn't been discovered by a wider audience of yet, written in an invented phonetic language. The main support to this claim is the similarities
                              found in word structure to some East Asian languages. Whatever the truth may be, most scholars agree it is too homogeneously constructed to be a hoax.

                  So far, the techniques we've covered have been converting text to text; encoded text, but nevertheless text. What if we could use something other than text
                  to hold our secret message? <b>Johannes Trithemius</b>, a German polymath, wrote prolifically on cryptography, but perhaps his most important work was
                  <i>Steganographia</i>. Ostensibly, the three volume work is about using magic to communicate with spirits; for this reason, the book was banned by the Catholic
                  church for some time. The first two books in the volume are fairly conventional, both explaining different encryption techniques. The last book, however, is much
                  more obscure and for many years was thought to be a strange astrological treatise with occult qualities. It was only in the late 90s, almost 500 years later, that the
                  "magical" elements were actually decoded as covertexts for more cryptographic content. The concealing of these messages within a seemingly unrelated text is probably
                  the first example of a practice known as <b>steganography</b>, a term obviously coined by Trithemius in this landmark work. Today, steganography is used in much more
                  advanced contexts like encoding bits inside a picture or for metadata in printing documents. Trithemius was truly a pioneer with this important cryptographic technique.

                              The book used both relatively normal encryption techniques and steganography to hide its messages. Books I and II generally consist of letters that,
                              in plaintext, seem to be invoking angelic help. However, with a release of a decryption key shortly after publication, the letters were found to have
                              concealed messages within the words. These were encrypted both with substitution ciphers and steganography. Book III, however, had no such decryption key and
                              thus appeared to mostly contain astrological charts corresponding to different "spirits", as seen in the picture above. Only as of recently were these charts found
                              to actually contain encrypted messages. Trithemius used 28 different versions of the alphabet, each corresponding to the spirits. The second picture shows the process
                              of decoding one of the first 2 books.

                  One of the main problems with all of our textual encryption techniques thus far have been their vulnerability to frequency analysis. Even in homophonic substitution,
                  it is still possible to break the encryption with a large enough encoded text to analyze. The notion of a <b>polyalphabetic cipher</b>, an encryption technique using
                  multiple alphabets throughout the encoding, was first proposed by <b>Leon Battista Alberti</b>. He proposed using a cipher disk to randomly an alphabet for each letter,
                  with the physical disk presenting an obvious problem when communicating covertly over long distances. The next major step was actually by Trithemius, who suggested switching
                  the alphabet iteratively for each letter in the message. His cipher, however, was trivial to break and needed improvement. <b>Giovan Battista Bellaso</b> suggested a "keyword"
                  that provides the guide for the alphabet shift to use at each letter. Probably the most refined version of this technique was made by <b>Blaise de Vigenère</b>, who suggested
                  a process called "key scheduling" to choose which key is used. This polyalphabetic technique became the standard encryption method for 100s of years, and even as of more recently
                  the notion of key scheduling as been used in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), an advanced cryptographic algorithm that was at one time employed by the US government.

                            Our polyalphabetic method works using a keyword to decide the alphabet. First, the key is repeated as many times as necessary to fit
                            the length of the plaintext. From there, for each letter in the text, we use the corresponding index of the key to decide which alphabet
                            to use for encoding. The table pictured above shows the alphabet to use for each key letter. For example, if letter 1 of the key is 'L' and letter
                            1 of the text is 'B', the equivalent cipher output would be 'M'. The output of this cipher technique is extremely resistant to traditional cryptanalysis.

                  Most of what we've covered so far has been theoretical; i.e. techniques for encryption, but not necessarily implementations. Perhaps the most famous instance
                  of cryptography actually being employed in this time period was in the <b>Babington Plot</b>. In the late 1500s, Elizabeth I held the crown of England, but there
                  were some opposed to her reign. These conspirators, led by <b>Anthony Babington</b>, looked to assassinate Elizabeth and install <b>Mary</b>, the Queen of Scotland, in her
                  place. To communicate with Mary, however, Babington needed security: both physical security to smuggle the letters, and cryptography to hide the messages. Unfortunately for
                  Babington and Mary, their letters were intercepted by loyalists from the beginning. <b>Thomas Phelippes</b>, a cryptanalyst loyal to Elizabeth, was able to break the cipher
                  quickly and discovered their plan. Cleverly, he sent a falsified message to Babington, asking to provide the names of his conspirators. This led the capture and execution
                  of Mary, Babington, and many others. The Babington Plot, though unsuccessful, was an example of the power of cryptography in world affairs.

                              shows the code table used by Mary, having both replacements for the normal alphabet and certain phrases. However, Phelippes was still able to decipher
                              the language with a combination of frequency analysis for the letters and simple inference for the phrases. The 1st image contains the forged postscript
                              Phelippes added to Mary's letter to Babington, asking for the names of the conspirators. Since he had completely deciphered the language, Babington was
                              unable to discern the forgery and thus incriminated himself directly to the loyalists.

                  There are many algorithms to encrypt and decrypt a message, but a different appplication for cryptography is to actually commit to some information
                  publically without revealing the information. The idea is if you can publish some encoded information, and later show a way to decode that info, the decoded
                  information must have been known when its encrypted version was published. Early astronomy was a very competitive practice, as astronomers wanted to hide their
                  findings while receiving recognition for discoveries. <b>Galileo</b>, when discovering the rings of Saturn, published a scrambled anagram of his results before
                  he was ready to fully publish his findings. This primitive <b>cryptographic commitment scheme</b> became common for astronomers, as it was mostly secure while also
                  putting a sort of "timestamp" on their findings. <b>Christiaan Huygens</b> also used this anagram technique for his findings on Saturn. Today, commitment schemes
                  using much more complex algorithms are extremely common and find use everywhere from prediction markets to cryptocurrencies. These astronomers, though using extremely
                  basic encryption technologies, were pioneers in the use of these types of schemes.

                              As I mentioned, the commitment scheme used by these astronomers generally used anagrams. Anagrams worked well for their purposes as 1) they were
                              easy to construct, and 2) they were virtually impossible to decode. An astronomer would write our their commitment phrase in Latin (the scientific
                              language of the day), re-arrange the letters in some arbitrary order, and then publish the scrambled message. Then, when they want to reveal their discovery,
                              they can provide the original text and anyone will be able to verify the anagram as valid. The example above shows Huygen's published commitment. The anagram,
                              written in alphabetical order, is "aaaaaaacccccdeeeeeghiiiiiiillllmmnnnnnnnnnooooppqrrstttttuuuuu", which would appear as gibberish to any third party. When
                              arranged correctly, however, the phrase is "annuto cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam coherente, ad eclipticam inclinato", Latin for
                              "it is encircled by a ring, thin, plane, nowhere attached inclined to the ecliptic." We can see the ease with which the message is hidden while still providing
                              a proof of existence.

                  In the interim between the time of Galileo and WWII, most of the improvements to cryptography were only incremental. Perhaps the most prominent was an improvement in
                  polyalphabetic cryptanalysis by <b>Charles Babbage</b>, but even that advance didn't have wide implications for the time. The most important historical event in
                  cryptography since Galileo, and something indicative of the technological revolution to come, was the breaking of the German <b>Enigma Cipher</b> during WWII. The Enigma
                  machine was a tool designed by the Germans to transmit messages securely during wartime. It used the most advanced cryptography of its time and used a rotor system with
                  multiple permutations to encrypt. Using knowledge of both the wiring of the machines and assumed flaws <b>Marian Rejewski</b>, a cryptanalyst at the <b>Polish Cipher Bureau</b>,
                  was able to break the machines. The British cryptanalyst <b>Alan Turing</b>, used Rejewski's research to improve on the techniques and automate the decryption on a larger
                  scale with a device called the <i>bombe</i>. Thes developments were considered pivotal in ensuring the Allied victory; more importantly, it signalled the beginning of
                  the Computing Age, led by Alan Turing. <br> </br>While the bombe was not a computer in the traditional sense, Turing would at one point design the first theoretical model for a
                  computer, called a Turing machine, create some of the first computers, and later even write on Artificial Intelligence. It's impossible to state how much Turing meant
                  for the revolution to come; he is truly the father of modern computing. Today, cryptography is a vital part of our technological society that often goes unappreciated.
                  Whenever we enter a password or go to a website, there are advanced algorithms encrypting our data and securing us from malicious parties. With the advanced math and
                  computer science principles that go into cryptographic techniques today, they look much different from the design of the earlier methods. However, on the lowest level,
                  the same principles of security that everyone from Vigenère to Turing used are just as relevant and necessary.

                              The Enigma cipher itself was based on a set of rotors used to scramble the data. Basically, as seen in the 1st picture, a person would enter the phrase using
                              the keyboard, the rotors would rotate creating an electrical circuit through contacts on their edges. A rotor by itself only performs a simple substitution
                              cipher. The security of the machine came from using multiple rotors in series to create a polyalphabetic cipher. If using 3 rotors, the machine could have
                               17,576 possible arrangements of the rotors (26 x 26 x 26). An additional layer of security added in WW2 was a plugboard in back, allowing the swapping of
                               individual letters on the keyboard. To crack the machine, Rejewski initially used German mistakes in procedure and his own theoretical math knowledge to work
                               out the wiring of the machine. However, German improvements in response made some of the Polish methods of cryptanalyis obsolete. Turing, working off of the Polish
                               methods, began designing the bombe for decryption. The machine essentially simulated the action of several Enigma machines wired together, as seen in the second picture. Multiple sets of rotors
                               can be run in tandem, allowing for the testing of different hypotheses simultaneously. These machines exploited the idea that a certain piece of text was likely to
                               be present in most German transmissions. These machines drastically improved the quality and speed of Allied decryption.
